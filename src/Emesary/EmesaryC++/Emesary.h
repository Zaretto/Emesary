*
*	File Type            : Implementation File
*
*	Description          : Provides generic inter-object communication. For an object to receive a message it
*	                     : must first register with a Transmitter, such as GlobalTransmitter, and implement the
*	                     : IReceiver interface. That's it.
*	                     : To send a message use a Transmitter with an object. That's all there is to it.
